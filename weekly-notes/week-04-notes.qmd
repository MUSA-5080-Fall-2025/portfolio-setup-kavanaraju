title: "Week 4 Notes - Mapping Census Data and Spatial Visualization"

## Key Concepts Learned
- Mapping is a form of analysis that reveals spatial structure, clustering, and inequities  
- Choropleth mapping using sf and ggplot2 helps visualize geographic variation  
- Consistent CRS is essential when combining spatial datasets  
- Census geography affects reliability because smaller geographies have higher margins of error  
- Ethical cartography emphasizes honest color choices, normalization, and communication of uncertainty  


## Coding Techniques
- Using get_acs with geometry set to TRUE to pull spatial ACS data  
- Joining ACS variables to shapefiles using left_join with GEOID  
- Creating maps with ggplot using geom_sf, scale_fill_viridis_c, theme_void, and coord_sf  
- Using classInt to create quantile, equal interval, and natural break classifications
- Exporting publication quality figures with ggsave 

## Questions & Challenges
- How to select the right classification method for different types of distributions?
- How to handle tracts with missing values or extremely large margins of error?
- How to choose color palettes that communicate differences without exaggerating them?

## Connections to Policy
- Maps directly influence decision making and resource allocation
- Ignoring uncertainty can mislead policymakers and disadvantage vulnerable groups
- Spatial visualization is essential for transportation planning, equity analysis, and
demographic assessment

## Reflection
- Map design involves interpretation and the same dataset can produce very different messages depending on visual choices
- This week highlighted the responsibility to be transparent and ethical when communicating spatial information
- I will apply these lessons by checking CRS carefully, evaluating multiple classification options, and including uncertainty in any policy facing map
