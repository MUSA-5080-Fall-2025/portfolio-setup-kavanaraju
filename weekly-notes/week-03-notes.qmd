## Key Concepts Learned
- **Visualization matters:** summary statistics can obscure patterns; outliers may represent critical communities.  
- Ethical responsibility to report MOE, show uncertainty, and avoid misleading visuals.  
- **Grammar of Graphics (ggplot2):**  
  Data → Aesthetics → Geometries → Visuals, with additional layers like scales, themes, and annotations.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** a detective process of exploring distributions, relationships, anomalies, and reliability before modeling.  
- **Data Joins:** left, right, inner, and full joins for integrating datasets in policy analysis.  

## Coding Techniques
- **ggplot2 basics:**  
  - Structure: `ggplot(data) + aes(x=var1, y=var2) + geom_*() + layers`.  
  - Aesthetic mappings: x, y, color, fill, size, shape, alpha.  
  - Adding layers with `+` for customization.  
- **EDA tools:** histograms, scatterplots, boxplots for detecting distributions and outliers.  
- **Data reliability:** use coefficient of variation (CV) thresholds to categorize estimates as reliable, somewhat reliable, or unreliable.  
- **dplyr joins:** `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `inner_join()`, `full_join()`.  

## Questions & Challenges
- How to best visualize **uncertainty** so that policymakers actually understand and act on it.  
- Practice needed in customizing ggplot themes for clear and professional presentation.  
- Still clarifying when to collapse categories or aggregate geographies to reduce statistical uncertainty.  

## Connections to Policy
- Poor visualization (e.g., ignoring MOEs) can directly misinform policy and harm vulnerable communities.  
- Reporting reliability aligns with the **AICP Code of Ethics** — transparency is both technical best practice and ethical obligation.  
- Visualizations tailored for different audiences (legislators, community groups, media) can shift how data drives decisions.  

## Reflection
- The most interesting insight was **Anscombe’s Quartet**: identical summary statistics but radically different patterns when visualized — proving the necessity of graphs.  
- I’ll apply this by always starting analysis with EDA and incorporating data quality checks into my visuals.  
- This week reinforced that visualization is not just aesthetic — it is a tool for **ethical communication** in public policy.
