---

## Part 1: Healthcare Access for Vulnerable Populations

### Research Question

**Which Pennsylvania counties have the highest proportion of vulnerable populations (elderly + low-income) living far from hospitals?**

Your analysis should identify counties that should be priorities for healthcare investment and policy intervention.

### Required Analysis Steps

Complete the following analysis, documenting each step with code and brief explanations:

#### Step 1: Data Collection (5 points)

Load the required spatial data:
- Pennsylvania county boundaries
- Pennsylvania hospitals (from lecture data)
- Pennsylvania census tracts

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Load required packages
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(tigris)
library(scales)
library(sf)
library(knitr)
library(patchwork)
library(here)

# Load spatial data
pa_counties <- st_read("./data/Pennsylvania_County_Boundaries.shp", quiet = TRUE)
hospitals <- st_read("./data/hospitals.geojson", quiet = TRUE)
census_tracts <- tracts(state = "PA", cb = TRUE, progress_bar = FALSE)

# Check that all data loaded correctly
glimpse(pa_counties)
glimpse(hospitals)
glimpse(census_tracts)

st_crs(pa_counties)
st_crs(hospitals)
st_crs(hospitals)
```

**Questions to answer:**
- How many hospitals are in your dataset?
  - 223 hospitals.

- How many census tracts?
  - 3445 census tracts.
  
- What coordinate reference system is each dataset in?
  - PA county boundaries CRS: GCS WGS 84 (Pseudo-Mercator) / EPSG 4326. 
  - PA census tracts CRS: PCS NAD 83 / EPSG 4269.
  - PA hospitals CRS: GCS WGS 84 (Pseudo-Mercator) / EPSG 4326.

---

#### Step 2: Get Demographic Data 

Use `tidycensus` to download tract-level demographic data for Pennsylvania.

**Required variables:**
- Total population
- Median household income
- Population 65 years and over (you may need to sum multiple age categories)

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Get demographic data from ACS

acs_vars_2022 <- load_variables(2022, "acs5", cache = TRUE) 

acs_vars_2022_65_above <- acs_vars_2022 %>% 
  filter(concept == "Sex by Age") %>%
  filter(str_detect(label, "([6-9][5-9]|[7-9][0-9]|85).*years"))

acs_age_pop <- acs_vars_2022_65_above$name

# In the wide format, we need names assigned to the 12 population vars based on age and sex
names(acs_age_pop) <- acs_vars_2022_65_above$label %>%
  str_to_lower() %>%
  str_replace_all("estimate!!(total!!)?", "") %>%  # remove 'estimate!!' and 'total!!' if present
  str_replace_all("!!|and| ", "_") %>%           # replace !!, 'and', and spaces with _
  str_replace_all("years", "") %>%               # remove 'years'
  str_replace_all("[^a-z0-9_]", "")             # remove any remaining punctuation

tract_demographics <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = c(
    total_pop = "B01003_001",
    median_income = "B19013_001",
    acs_age_pop
  ),
  state = "PA",
  year = 2022,
  output = "wide"
)

final_tract_demographics <- tract_demographics %>%
  mutate(
    pop_65_plus = rowSums(
      select(., starts_with("total_male_") | starts_with("total_female_")) %>%
        select(., ends_with("E")),
      na.rm = TRUE
    )
  ) %>%
  select(GEOID, NAME, total_popE, median_incomeE, pop_65_plus, 
         total_popM, median_incomeM)

# Join to tract boundaries
tracts_with_data <- census_tracts %>%
  left_join(final_tract_demographics, by = "GEOID")

sum(is.na(tracts_with_data$median_incomeE))
median(tracts_with_data$median_incomeE, na.rm = TRUE)

```

**Questions to answer:**
- What year of ACS data are you using?
  - 2022 ACS Data
  
- How many tracts have missing income data?
  - 62 tracts

- What is the median income across all PA census tracts?
  - $70188

---

#### Step 3: Define Vulnerable Populations 

Identify census tracts with vulnerable populations based on TWO criteria:
1. Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)
2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria
tracts_with_data <- tracts_with_data %>%
  mutate(pct_65_plus = (pop_65_plus / total_popE) * 100)

income_threshold <- quantile(
  tracts_with_data$median_incomeE, 
  0.25, 
  na.rm = TRUE
)
elderly_threshold <- quantile(
  tracts_with_data$pct_65_plus,
  0.75,
  na.rm = TRUE
)

tracts_with_data <- tracts_with_data %>%
  mutate(
    low_income = median_incomeE <= income_threshold,
    high_elderly = pct_65_plus >= elderly_threshold,
    vulnerable = low_income & high_elderly
  )

n_vulnerable_tracts <- sum(tracts_with_data$vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE)
pct_vulnerable_tracts <- n_vulnerable_tracts / nrow(tracts_with_data) * 100

```

**Questions to answer:**
- What income threshold did you choose and why?
  - I used a quantile based rule to flag relatively low incomes within Pennsylvania. The cutoff is the lowest 25 percent of tract median incomes. With 2022 data this equals $55924. This method is future proof because the threshold updates automatically as new data arrive.

- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?
  - I used the same quantile approach as before but focused on the share of residents aged 65 and above. Tracts in the highest 25 percent for elderly population were identified as having a significant older population. With 2022 data this threshold corresponds to 23.1 percent of residents being 65 years or older.

- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?
  - A total of 165 tracts meet both vulnerability criteria, which include having income in the lowest 25 percent of Pennsylvania census tracts and an elderly population in the highest 25 percent.

- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?
  - These tracts make up about 4.8 percent of all Pennsylvania census tracts, with 165 out of 3,445 meeting the definition.

---

#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals 

For each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Transform to appropriate projected CRS
pa_projection <- 3365 # NAD83 / Pennsylvania South

pa_counties <- st_transform(pa_counties, crs = pa_projection)
tracts_with_data <- st_transform(tracts_with_data, crs = pa_projection)
hospitals <- st_transform(hospitals, crs = pa_projection)

# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital
tract_centroids <- st_centroid(tracts_with_data)
tracts_with_data <- tracts_with_data %>%
  mutate(
    dist_to_hospital = st_distance(tract_centroids, hospitals)  %>% 
    apply(1, min) %>% 
    as.numeric() / 1609.34
  )

tracts_with_data %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  filter(vulnerable == TRUE) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_distance = mean(dist_to_hospital, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_distance = max(dist_to_hospital, na.rm = TRUE),
    more_than_15_miles = sum(dist_to_hospital > 15, na.rm = TRUE),
  )

```

**Requirements:**
- Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania

- Calculate distances in miles

- Explain why you chose your projection
  - I used NAD83 Pennsylvania South EPSG 3365 for the statewide analysis. Pennsylvania has two State Plane zones that minimize distortion across its wide east to west extent. Instead of performing separate analyses for each zone I applied the South zone projection to the entire state to maintain consistency and efficiency while keeping measurement accuracy reasonable. This choice causes some distortion in the northern counties but it remains within acceptable limits for this analysis.

**Questions to answer:**
- What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?
  - 15.57 miles

- What is the maximum distance?
  - 62.86 miles

- How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?
  - 56 tracts

---

#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas 

Define "underserved" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Create underserved variable
tracts_with_data <- tracts_with_data %>%
  mutate(
    underserved = vulnerable & dist_to_hospital > 15
  )

tracts_with_data %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  summarise(
    n_underserved = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_vulnerable = sum(vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE),
    pct_vulnerable_underserved = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE) * 100
  )

```

**Questions to answer:**
- How many tracts are underserved?
  - 56 tracts

- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?
  - 33.94%

- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?
  - I wasn't surprised. I examined the counties that contain these underserved tracts and found that most are located in rural Pennsylvania where an aging population and lower income levels are more common. These areas also tend to have greater distances between communities and hospitals which helps explain the limited access.

---

#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level

Use spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Spatial join tracts to counties
tracts_by_county <- tracts_with_data %>% 
  st_join(pa_counties %>% select(COUNTY_NAM), largest = TRUE)

# Aggregate statistics by county
county_stats <- tracts_by_county %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%
  summarise(
    total_tracts = n(), # including to understand the scale of the county
    vulnerable_tracts = sum(vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE),
    underserved_tracts = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),
    pct_vulnerable_underserved = round(
      ifelse(vulnerable_tracts > 0, 
             (underserved_tracts / vulnerable_tracts) * 100, 0), 1),
    avg_dist_to_hospital = round(mean(dist_to_hospital, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    total_pop_in_vulnerable = sum(total_popE[vulnerable == TRUE], na.rm = TRUE),
  )  %>%
  arrange(desc(pct_vulnerable_underserved))

county_stats %>%
  kable(col.names = c("County", "Total Tracts", "Vulnerable Tracts", 
                      "Underserved Tracts", "% Vulnerable", "Avg Distance (mi)", "Total Pop in Vulnerable Tracts"))

county_stats %>%
  head(18) %>%
  select(COUNTY_NAM, vulnerable_tracts, underserved_tracts, pct_vulnerable_underserved)

tracts_by_county %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  filter(underserved == TRUE) %>%
  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%
  summarise(
    underserved_tracts = n(),
    vulnerable_pop_far_from_hospitals = sum(total_popE, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(vulnerable_pop_far_from_hospitals)) %>%
  head(5)

```

**Required county-level statistics:**
- Number of vulnerable tracts
- Number of underserved tracts  
- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved
- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts
- Total vulnerable population

**Questions to answer:**
- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?
  - 18 counties have the same percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved. Those 18 counties are printed above.

- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?
  - Fayette, Northumberland, Westmoreland, and Clearfield, and Somerset.

- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?
  - Most of the counties are large rural counties.

#### Step 7: Create Summary Table 

Create a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Create and format priority counties table
tracts_by_county %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  filter(underserved == TRUE) %>%
  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%
  summarise(
    underserved_tracts = n(),
    vulnerable_pop_far_from_hospitals = sum(total_popE, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(vulnerable_pop_far_from_hospitals)) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  kable(
    col.names = c("County", "Underserved Tracts", "Total Population"),
    align = c("l", "r", "r"),
    format.args = list(big.mark = ","),
    caption = "Top 10 Priority Counties for Healthcare Investment - Ranked by total population in underserved vulnerable tracts (>15 miles from nearest hospital)"
  )

```
Vulnerable tracts refer to areas that fall within the lowest quarter of median household income and the highest quarter of population aged sixty-five and older. Underserved tracts describe those vulnerable areas where residents live more than fifteen miles from the closest hospital.

**Requirements:**
- Use `knitr::kable()` or similar for formatting
- Include descriptive column names
- Format numbers appropriately (commas for population, percentages, etc.)
- Add an informative caption
- Sort by priority (you decide the metric)

## Part 2: Comprehensive Visualization 

Using the skills from Week 3 (Data Visualization), create publication-quality maps and charts.

### Map 1: County-Level Choropleth 

Create a choropleth map showing healthcare access challenges at the county level.

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Create county-level access map
county_map_data <- pa_counties %>%
  left_join(county_stats, by = "COUNTY_NAM")

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = county_map_data, 
          aes(fill = pct_vulnerable_underserved),
          color = "white", 
          size = 0.3) +
  geom_sf(data = hospitals, 
          color = "red", 
          size = 1, 
          alpha = 0.75,
          shape = 1) +
  scale_fill_gradient(
    low = "#deebf7",
    high = "#08306b",
    na.value = "grey90",
    name = "% of Vulnerable Census Tracts\nthat are Underserved ",
    labels = function(x) paste0(x, "%")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Healthcare Access Challenges in Pennsylvania",
    subtitle = "Percentage of vulnerable tracts in a county that are underserved (>15 miles from a hospital)",
    caption = "Vulnerable tracts: bottom 25% in median income & top 25% in population 65+, relative to the rest of PA\nBlue crosses indicate hospital locations"
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0.5),
    legend.position = "left"
  )

```

**Requirements:**
- Fill counties by percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved
- Include hospital locations as points
- Use an appropriate color scheme
- Include clear title, subtitle, and caption
- Use `theme_void()` or similar clean theme
- Add a legend with formatted labels

---

### Map 2: Detailed Vulnerability Map 

Create a map highlighting underserved vulnerable tracts.

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Create detailed tract-level map
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = tracts_with_data, 
          fill = "gray85", 
          color = "white", 
          size = 0.1) +
  geom_sf(data = tracts_with_data %>% filter(underserved == TRUE), 
          fill = "red",
          color = "white", 
          size = 0.1) +
  geom_sf(data = pa_counties, 
          fill = NA, 
          color = "black", 
          size = 0.5) +
  # Hospital locations
  geom_sf(data = hospitals, 
          color = "#08306b", 
          size = 1, 
          alpha = 0.75,
          shape = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Underserved Vulnerable Census Tracts in Pennsylvania",
    subtitle = "Red areas show vulnerable tracts where the center is more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital",
    caption = "Vulnerable tracts: bottom 25% in median income & top 25% in population 65+, relative to the rest of PA\nBlue crosses indicate hospital locations"
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5, margin = margin(b = 10)),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 10)),
    plot.margin = margin(20, 20, 20, 20)
  )

```

**Requirements:**
- Show underserved vulnerable tracts in a contrasting color
- Include county boundaries for context
- Show hospital locations
- Use appropriate visual hierarchy (what should stand out?)
- Include informative title and subtitle

---

### Chart: Distribution Analysis

Create a visualization showing the distribution of distances to hospitals for vulnerable populations.

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Create distribution visualization
tracts_with_data %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  filter(vulnerable == TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dist_to_hospital)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "#08306b", color = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 15, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Distance to Nearest Hospital for Vulnerable Tracts",
    x = "Distance (miles)",
    y = "Number of Vulnerable Tracts",
    caption = "Vulnerable tracts: bottom 25% in median income & top 25% in population 65+, relative to the rest of PA\nDashed line shows 15-mile threshold used to define underserved.\nThere is a clustering of tracts with relatively close hospital access (<15 miles) and a very long tail beyond the 15 mile cutoff."
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

**Suggested chart types:**
- Histogram or density plot of distances
- Box plot comparing distances across regions
- Bar chart of underserved tracts by county
- Scatter plot of distance vs. vulnerable population size

**Requirements:**
- Clear axes labels with units
- Appropriate title
- Professional formatting
- Brief interpretation (1-2 sentences as a caption or in text)

---

## Part 3: Bring Your Own Data Analysis 

Choose your own additional spatial dataset and conduct a supplementary analysis.

**Infrastructure & Services: Polling Place Accessibility**
- **Data:** Polling Places, SEPTA stops, Census tracts (elderly population, disability rates)
- **Question:** "Are polling places accessible for elderly and disabled voters?"
- **Operations:** Buffer polling places and transit stops, identify vulnerable populations, find areas lacking access
- **Policy relevance:** Voting rights, election infrastructure, ADA compliance

### Your Analysis

**Your Task:**

1. **Find and load additional data**
   - Document your data source
   - Check and standardize the CRS
   - Provide basic summary statistics

```{r}
# Load your additional dataset
polling_places <- st_read("./data/polling_places.geojson", quiet = TRUE)
st_crs(polling_places)$input
polling_places <- st_transform(polling_places, crs = pa_projection)
st_crs(polling_places)$input

philly_tracts <- tracts_by_county %>%
  filter(COUNTY_NAM == "PHILADELPHIA")

polling_places %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  count(accessibility_code) %>%
  mutate(
    percentage = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 1),
    accessibility_type = case_when(
      accessibility_code == "A" ~ "Alternate Entrance",
      accessibility_code == "B" ~ "Substantially Accessible",
      accessibility_code == "F" ~ "Fully Accessible",
      accessibility_code == "M" ~ "Accessibility Modified",
      accessibility_code == "N" ~ "Not Accessible",
      accessibility_code == "R" ~ "Accessible With Ramp",
      TRUE ~ "Unknown"
    )
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  select(accessibility_code, accessibility_type, n, percentage) %>%
  bind_rows(
    summarise(., 
              accessibility_code = "TOTAL",
              accessibility_type = "",
              n = sum(n),
              percentage = sum(percentage))
  ) %>%
  kable(
    col.names = c("Code", "Accessibility Type", "Count", "%"),
    align = c("l", "l", "r", "r"),
    caption = "Polling Locations in Philadelphia by Accesibility Type"
  )

septa_bus_stops <- st_read("./data/2022_SEPTA_Bus_Stops.geojson", quiet = TRUE)

st_crs(septa_bus_stops)$input
septa_bus_stops <- st_transform(septa_bus_stops, crs = pa_projection)
st_crs(septa_bus_stops)$input

philly_bus_stops <- septa_bus_stops %>%
  st_filter(philly_tracts)

```

**Questions to answer:**
- What dataset did you choose and why?
  - I selected the polling place dataset because it includes detailed accessibility designations that make it possible to study how voting sites accommodate residents with different mobility needs. The dataset also pairs well with SEPTA bus stop locations, which I used to examine how transit access aligns with these polling sites across Philadelphia. My goal was to identify voting locations that may lack convenient bus service nearby.

- What is the data source and date?
  - The polling place information comes from OpenDataPhilly, last updated on December 8, 2014.The SEPTA bus stop data were obtained from the SEPTA Open Data Portal for 2022.
  
- How many features does it contain?
  - There are 1,703 polling sites listed within Philadelphia and 18,066 bus stops across SEPTA’s broader service area. When limited to the city’s census tracts, the number of bus stops decreases to 10,654.

- What CRS is it in? Did you need to transform it?
  - Both datasets were originally in the WGS 84 coordinate system and were reprojected to EPSG 3365 to align with the Pennsylvania State Plane South coordinate system used in this analysis.

---

2. **Pose a research question**

To what extent are Philadelphia’s polling places accessible by public transit, and which ones are located beyond walking distances of 5, 10, or 15 minutes from the nearest bus stop?

---

3. **Conduct spatial analysis**

Use at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.

**Required operations (choose 2+):**
- Buffers
- Spatial joins
- Spatial filtering with predicates
- Distance calculations
- Intersections or unions
- Point-in-polygon aggregation

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Your spatial analysis
bus_buffer_5min <- st_buffer(philly_bus_stops, dist = 0.20 * 5280)
bus_buffer_10min <- st_buffer(philly_bus_stops, dist = 0.40 * 5280)
bus_buffer_15min <- st_buffer(philly_bus_stops, dist = 0.60 * 5280)

# Doing this to consolidate buffers for easier analysis
bus_zone_5min <- st_union(bus_buffer_5min)
bus_zone_10min <- st_union(bus_buffer_10min)
bus_zone_15min <- st_union(bus_buffer_15min)

polling_no_transit_5min <- polling_places %>%
  st_difference(bus_zone_5min)

polling_no_transit_10min <- polling_places %>%

polling_no_transit_15min <- polling_places %>%
  st_difference(bus_zone_15min)

# Here, I'm finding the distance to the nearest bus stop, and setting some boolean variables for my time categories.
polling_with_distance <- polling_places %>%
  mutate(
    dist_to_bus = st_distance(., philly_bus_stops) %>% 
      apply(1, min) %>% 
      as.numeric() / 5280,
    beyond_5min = dist_to_bus > 0.20,
    beyond_10min = dist_to_bus > 0.40,
    beyond_15min = dist_to_bus > 0.60
  )

    beyond_15min = sum(beyond_15min, na.rm = TRUE),
    pct_beyond_5min = round((beyond_5min / total_polling) * 100, 1),
    pct_beyond_10min = round((beyond_10min / total_polling) * 100, 1),
    pct_beyond_15min = round((beyond_15min / total_polling) * 100, 1)
  )

map_5min <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = philly_tracts, fill = "gray95", color = "white", size = 0.2) +

**Analysis requirements:**
- Clear code comments explaining each step
- Appropriate CRS transformations
- Summary statistics or counts
- At least one map showing your findings
- Brief interpretation of results (3-5 sentences)

**Your interpretation:**
Polling places located more than a five minute walk from a bus stop appear to present the most potential for further study. These sites are largely concentrated along the city’s outer edges, suggesting spatial gaps in transit coverage. Future work could assess the surrounding street environments, since a short walk through a calm residential block differs greatly from one that requires crossing high-traffic corridors. This analysis could also integrate additional layers such as polling place accessibility ratings, their presence in vulnerable census tracts, and proximity to other transit options including SEPTA rail lines, trolleys, bike share stations, and bike lanes.

## Finally - A few comments about your incorporation of feedback!
Broke down my code even more and cleaned up the document.
