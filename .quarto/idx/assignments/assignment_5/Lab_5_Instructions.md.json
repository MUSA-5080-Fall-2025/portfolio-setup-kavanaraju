{"title":"HW5: Your Turn!","markdown":{"headingText":"HW5: Your Turn!","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nFor Homework 5, you'll work either all byyyy yourself or in teams of 2 to:\n\n## Part 1: Replicate with Different Quarter (alternately, you could do a longer time-span by merging multiple quarters together. I'm not picky about that)\n\n1. **Download data** for Q2, Q3, or Q4 2024 from: https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/\n\n2. **Adapt this code** to work with your quarter:\n\n   - Update date ranges for weather data\n   - Check for any data structure changes\n   - Create the same 5 models\n   - Calculate MAE for each model\n\n3. **Compare results** to Q1 2025:\n\n   - How do MAE values compare? Why might they differ?\n   - Are temporal patterns different (e.g., summer vs. winter)?\n   - Which features are most important in your quarter?\n\n## Part 2: Error Analysis \n\nAnalyze your model's errors in detail:\n\n1. **Spatial patterns:**\n\n   - Create error maps\n   - Identify neighborhoods with high errors\n   - Hypothesize why (missing features? different demand patterns?)\n\n2. **Temporal patterns:**\n\n   - When are errors highest?\n   - Do certain hours/days have systematic under/over-prediction?\n   - Are there seasonal patterns?\n\n3. **Demographic patterns:**\n\n   - Relate errors to census characteristics\n   - Are certain communities systematically harder to predict?\n   - What are the equity implications?\n\n## Part 3: Feature Engineering & model improvement\n\nBased on your error analysis, add 2-3 NEW features to improve the model:\n\n**Potential features to consider:**\n\n*Temporal features:*\n\n- Holiday indicators (Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day)\n- School calendar (Penn, Drexel, Temple in session?)\n- Special events (concerts, sports games, conventions)\n- Day of month (payday effects?)\n\n*Weather features:*\n\n- Feels-like temperature (wind chill/heat index)\n- \"Perfect biking weather\" indicator (60-75°F, no rain)\n- Precipitation forecast (not just current)\n- Weekend + nice weather interaction\n\n*Spatial features:*\n\n- Distance to Center City\n- Distance to nearest university\n- Distance to nearest park\n- Points of interest nearby (restaurants, offices, bars)\n- Station capacity\n- Bike lane connectivity\n\n*Trip history features:*\n\n- Rolling 7-day average demand\n- Same hour last week\n- Station \"type\" clustering (residential, commercial, tourist)\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n- Add your features to the best model \n- Compare MAE before and after\n- Explain *why* you chose these features\n- Did they improve predictions? Where?\n\n**Try a poisson model for count data**\n\n- Does this improve model fit?\n\n## Part 4: Critical Reflection \n\nWrite 1-2 paragraphs addressing:\n\n1. **Operational implications:**\n   - Is your final MAE \"good enough\" for Indego to use?\n   - When do prediction errors cause problems for rebalancing?\n   - Would you recommend deploying this system? Under what conditions?\n\n2. **Equity considerations:**\n   - Do prediction errors disproportionately affect certain neighborhoods?\n   - Could this system worsen existing disparities in bike access?\n   - What safeguards would you recommend?\n\n3. **Model limitations:**\n   - What patterns is your model missing?\n   - What assumptions might not hold in real deployment?\n   - How would you improve this with more time/data?\n\n---\n\n# Submission Requirements\n\n## What to Submit (per team)\n\n1. **Rmd file** with all your code (commented!)\n2. **HTML output** with results and visualizations\n3. **Brief report** summarizing (with supporting data & visualization):\n\n   - Your quarter and why you chose it\n   - Model comparison results\n   - Error analysis insights\n   - New features you added and why\n   - Critical reflection on deployment\n\n## Tips for Success\n\n1. **Start early** - data download and processing takes time\n2. **Work together** - pair programming is your friend\n3. **Test incrementally** - don't wait until the end to run code\n4. **Document everything** - explain your choices\n5. **Be creative** - the best features come from understanding Philly!\n6. **Think critically** - technical sophistication isn't enough\n\n---","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"Lab_5_Instructions.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
