## Key Concepts Learned
- Introduction to Git/GitHub for version control, collaboration, and portfolio building
- Role of Quarto in producing reproducible, professional reports that combine code, narrative, and outputs

## Coding Techniques
- as_tibble() to convert data frames into tibbles for better display
- Core dplyr verbs: select(), filter(), mutate(), summarize(), group_by(), rename(), case_when()
- Use of pipes %>% to build step-by-step workflows

## Questions & Challenges
- Still working on fully grasping the Git workflow (commit, push, pull) and how GitHub Classroom integrates with it

## Connections to Policy
- Learning GitHub workflows builds professional habits useful for collaborative policy projects in agencies and MPOs

## Reflection
- Most interesting: seeing how professional portfolios can be built from class assignments and used in future job searches
- Iâ€™ll apply this knowledge by keeping my GitHub portfolio clean and well-documented, so it doubles as both a learning record and something I can show employers
